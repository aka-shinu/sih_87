Problem Statement Title	
Development of a Digital Mental Health and Psychological Support System for Students in Higher Education
Description	
Problem Statement:

Context:
Mental health issues among college students have significantly increased in recent years, including anxiety, depression, burnout, sleep disorders, academic stress, and social isolation. However, there is a major gap in the availability, accessibility, and stigma-free delivery of mental health support in most higher education institutions, especially in rural and semi-urban colleges.

Problem Faced:
- Absence of a structured, scalable, and stigma-free psychological intervention system.
- Lack of early detection and preventive mental health tools.
- Under-utilization of college counselling centres due to fear of judgment or lack of awareness.
- No centralized mental health monitoring or data-driven policy framework within institutions.

Proposed Technological Challenge:
Develop a Digital Psychological Intervention System (web-based and/or mobile app) with the following capabilities:
1. AI-guided First-Aid Support: Interactive chat box that offers coping strategies and refers students to professionals when needed.
2. Confidential Booking System: For appointment with on-campus counsellor or mental health helpline.
3. Psychoeducational Resource Hub: Videos, relaxation audio, mental wellness guides in regional languages.
4. Peer Support Platform: Moderated peer-to-peer support forum with trained student volunteers.
5. Admin Dashboard: Anonymous data analytics for authorities to recognize trends and plan interventions.

Department/Section Owning the Problem:
Department of Student Welfare / Department of Psychology / Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC).

Problem Explanation Video:
To be prepared by students.

Need for Digital Platform for Psychological Support:
Most available apps are generic, Western-oriented, or paid. They do not integrate:
• Regional cultural context and language
• Institution-specific customization
• Offline support mapping (e.g., linking with college counsellors)
• Real-time analytics for admin
Hence, a tailored open-source solution is needed.

Sample Data/Data Structures for Participants:
• Level of problem through standard psychological screening tools (PHQ-9 / GAD-7 / GHQ, etc.)
• Mock student profiles (anonymized)
• Institutional support structure (counsellor availability, resources, helpline)
